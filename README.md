Track 2: Educational Equity
The cost, debt, and economic return of higher education are central to social mobility. This track challenges students to build a tool that helps prospective students and families navigate these complex choices. Using two complex datasets, teams will figure out the best way to identify and explore institutions based on a user's needs. The goal is to democratize access to high-quality advice and guide students, especially from vulnerable populations, toward institutions that offer high value, low debt, and a strong record of equitable outcomes.
